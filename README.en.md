# La Réunion DataCup Challenge - ESI'DEV

The [Réunion DataCup Challenge](https://data.regionreunion.com/p/page-reunion-datacup-challenge) is a unique event that showcases all the skills involved in handling data: extraction, processing, modelling, etc. Supported by Région Réunion, *La Réunion DataCup Challenge* is part of a framework of cooperation with the region's data producers who want to open up, share and promote their data. The partners are working on a wide range of issues, from resource conservation to the economy, as well as the concerns of local authorities and their residents.

The aim of this second edition is to continue to unite a community around the region's open data, and to initiate projects that are sustainable and useful to as many people as possible.

## 'Impact des éruptions volcaniques sur la qualité de l'air de la Réunion’ (Impact of volcanic eruptions on air quality in Réunion), supported by Atmo

This challenge is part of the context of monitoring air pollution, particularly due to the diffusion of gases such as sulphur dioxide. The Piton de la Fournaise erupts regularly, which can cause strong outgassing, leading to peaks in sulphur dioxide pollution. This has a global impact on the population of Réunion.

## **Documentation**

Our solution addresses the problem by providing a dynamic display tool for sulphur dioxide concentrations. It consists of setting up a map of the meeting on a web page, which displays the points of the Atmo measuring stations in space. From these points, users can see how sulphur dioxide concentrations have changed over the last 3 days. This solution is aimed at people with respiratory problems, sports enthusiasts and anyone interested in air pollution levels.
